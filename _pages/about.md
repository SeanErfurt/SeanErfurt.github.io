Hi! my name is Sean, and I am a skilled software engineer with over 8 years of experience, focused on web scraping and data pipelines. Although I have been a software engineer since college, I now want to pursue my true passion of working with electrical and mechanical systems.

My interest in machines started at a young age, watching BattleBots and How It's Made on the Discovery Channel. Watching combat robotics again inspired me to make my own PLAntweight robot this year. I 3D-printed the frame, learned how to select electrical components and solder them together, and set up the radio transmitter. I liked the experience a lot, and I'm hoping to compete in a tournament soon! I've also built my own FPV drone and Electronic Skateboard based on existing DIY designs, adapted to the parts I could get a hold of in these volatile times.

Ultimately I want to work hands-on in an industrial setting, leveraging my past programming expertise as well. My sense of satisfaction comes from making a positive difference: whether it's keeping vital operations running, or reducing a facility's energy usage, or any other kind of essential work. Now that I've learned how to solder and use a multi-meter, my next goal is to learn how to program PLCs using ladder logic.
